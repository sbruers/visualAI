Hi, I'm Sasskia Bruers Freyssinet,

A researcher in AI and neuroscience specializing in efficient deep learning models for computer vision. I like to learn new concepts by explaining them visually. I've been making these graphs and visuals for years on my way to learn new deep learning techniques. I thought I would share it here in case it is helpful to anyone else.  

I've been an R&D Engineer at BrainChip (Toulouse, France) since 2018, developing custom deep learning models optimized for resource-constrained devices. My job often entails optimizing SOTA models (regularization, pruning, quantization) to make them more efficient. I've done this in both keras and pytorch. 

Originally, I did a PhD in visual neuroscience, trying to better understand how brain oscillations influence visual perception.
